# Conrad Parker Profile

My Profile

## Overview

An attempt to re-build my well out of date profile page using pure Javascript and CSS. Yes, you got it. No frameworks or frills. Just back to basics. I'm not against frameworks by any means and believe they have their place. I just think Javascript and CSS have both come so far over the past few years. For a profile page it should be enough and give me opportunity to try out their new features.
