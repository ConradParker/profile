# Conrad Parker Profile

My Profile

## Overview

Attempt to re-build my well out of date profile page using pure Javascript and CSS. Yes you got it no frameworks, no frills, just back to basics. I'm not against frameworks by any means and believe they have their place. I just think for a simple profile page or pages a framework is probably overkill. Also I believe Javascript and CSS have both come on in leaps and bounds over the past few years and am anjoying learning their new features.
