# My Profile

## Overview

An attempt to re-build my well out of date profile page using pure HTML, Javascript and CSS. Yes, you got it. No frameworks or frills. Just back to basics. I'm not against frameworks or libraries by any means and they certainly have their place. I just believe plain HTML, Javascript and CSS have all improved over the past few years and for my profile page it should be enough. It also gave me an opportunity to try out some of their new features and see how much can be done.
