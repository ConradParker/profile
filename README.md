# Conrad Parker Profile

My Profile

## Overview

An attempt to re-build my well out of date profile page using pure Javascript and CSS. Yes, you got it. No frameworks or frills. Just back to basics. I'm not against frameworks by any means and believe they have their place. I believe Javascript and CSS have both improved over the past few years and for my profile page it should be enough. Also it gives me opportunity to try out some of the new features.

### Objectives

- Create a SPA for user friendly experience.
- Use web components to enable re-use.
- Use ES6 modules for better code structure.
- CSS
  - Use Grid and Flexbox for layout.
  - Use BEM naming for good structure.
  - Use variables.
